  "summary": "Build an Android (8+) app \"OTP Auto Copy\" that securely detects OTP SMS via SMS User Consent/Retriever APIs, extracts 4–8 digit OTPs, copies them to clipboard with user feedback, works fully offline, stores/transmits no OTP data, and complies with Google Play SMS/privacy policies using a Kotlin MVVM + Clean Architecture + Compose + Coroutines + Hilt stack.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Use SMS User Consent API and/or SMS Retriever API to avoid requesting unrestricted READ_SMS and align with Google Play policies.",
    "App must operate fully offline: no network calls, no analytics, no logging of OTP content, and no persistence of OTP data.",
    "Clipboard handling should include automatic clearing after configurable timeout to reduce sensitive-data exposure.",
    "Tech stack: Kotlin, MVVM + Clean Architecture, Jetpack Compose UI, Coroutines for async, Hilt for DI."
