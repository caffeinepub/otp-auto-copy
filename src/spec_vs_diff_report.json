  "summary": "The diff adds a React documentation hub with sidebar navigation, a dedicated “Platform & Limitations” section, an OTP extraction playground (extract/copy + clipboard auto-clear scheduling), and a green/emerald privacy-focused theme. However, some BuildRequest acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the truncated diffs, and several unrelated/auth/network-capable features were added that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All eight documentation deliverables are present (architecture, permissions, OTP detection + rationale, regex/heuristics, Kotlin snippets, UI screen specs, compliance checklist, privacy policy outline) and easy to navigate.",
      "reason": "Navigation items for all deliverables exist, but the actual content for most sections is truncated in the diff; only the Overview and Platform & Limitations sections are shown with partial content, so the presence/coverage of the remaining deliverables cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated) — navItems include all sections",
        "frontend/src/docs/docsContent.ts (truncated) — shows Overview and Platform & Limitations; remainder truncated"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Non-OTP input does not produce a code and clearly indicates no OTP was detected.",
      "reason": "The playground component is truncated right after the extracted OTP rendering branch begins; there is no visible evidence of a specific UI state/message for the 'no OTP detected' case.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/playground/OtpPlayground.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Include a user-configurable auto-clear clipboard timer setting (e.g., 15s/30s/60s/never).",
      "reason": "The playground imports Select components and uses a stored clearDelay, but the truncated file does not show the actual Select options (15/30/60/never) rendered in the UI.",

    {
      "description": "React Query-based backend actor creation hook (network-capable integration with an IC canister).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for backend calls/actor wiring for this documentation/playground experience; adding actor creation and query invalidation is out of scope and could introduce network behavior unrelated to OTP extraction.",

        "frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Motoko backend canister stub (empty actor).",
      "reason": "No backend functionality was requested for the documentation hub or OTP playground; an empty backend module is not part of the stated requirements.",

        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "An additional CSS theme file at frontend/index.css that appears unrelated to the applied theme imported by the app.",
      "reason": "The app imports ./index.css from frontend/src/main.tsx; adding a second top-level frontend/index.css is not requested and may be redundant/confusing.",
